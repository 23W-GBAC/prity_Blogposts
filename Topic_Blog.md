# WEB SCRAPPING AND SENDING MESSAGE OR NOTIFICATION TO TELEGRAM

The topic is to scrap prices from competitors' products from ecommerce websites. I have chosen ebay to scrap the price from there. The idea is to choose a competitor and a specific product from that competitor. Monitor that product price changing activity and notify the owner that the competitor price has changed.


It is related to me because my husband was doing e-commerce business a few years ago and he was facing some issues during the competitor analysis. There are many ecommerce sellers who sell the same products. The product price varies from seller to seller. So new sellers need to choose a price which will attract customers. 
The price should not be much lower and much higher than the competitors. To find a suitable price to increase the sell, the analyses of competitors products prices need to be done regularly since the price is changed often. So it is usually done manually one by one in spreadsheets or in docs. But it takes a lot of time. There are some big direct competitors in e-commerce who need to be monitored always. If the price drops, it is important to get the notification. 
Based on that the new price can be set. Now I have decided to take this in my project to solve these challenges and make the work easier usingÂ automation.
